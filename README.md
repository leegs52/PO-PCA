# PO-PCA
Probabilistic Orthogonal-signal-corrected Principal Component Analysis

## Usage
* Algorithms used in experiments can be implemented by running 
```
$ matlab popca_main.m
$ matlab popca_eval.m
```
* A Bayesian choice of the optimal dimensionality is obtained by popca_main.m
* Verification of our automatic model selection is performed by popca_eval.m
